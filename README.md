Data obtained from Fletcher et al., 2017 (GEO:GSE95601). File: GSE95601_oeHBCdiff_Cufflinks_eSet.Rda.gz 


Primary filteration scRNA-seq data from contamination and other technical issues was achieved by following the same steps instructed in 'oeHBCdiff\_filtering.R' file (https://github.com/rufletch/p63-HBC-diff) with only changing the number of cells threshold (from 5 to 1).

Further filtration, normalization and analysis of MOE data were done using Seurat package.
